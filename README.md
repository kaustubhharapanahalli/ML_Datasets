# Machine Learning Datasets

This file contains a list of Machine Learning Datasets which will help you get started with Machine Learning and go on to depths of Machine Learning problems. 



This repo starts with a few easy dataset and then goes on to have problems related to Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing and Recurrent Learning and other AI domains.
